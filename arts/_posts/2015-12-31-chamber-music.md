# Playing the Viola

Below I've categorized all of the specific technical lessons/techniques I've learned this semester. Many could feasibly fit in more than one category \- the musical techniques I've learned this semester are deeply integrated. The sentences below are my attempt to summarize all the techniques and lessons based on common themes:

> No action is abrupt or unexpected. Every action is anticipated and executed confidently, with grace \- and with sensitivity to the context and intent of the music. Actions maximize control of the instrument and sound.

I think the quote above sets a high mark that doesn't yet characterize the way I play the viola, but I'm working towards it.

# Recording the Viola

I synthesized my learning from [_Big Studio Secrets for Home Recording and Production_](http://www.amazon.com/Studio-Secrets-Home-Recording-Production/dp/1435455053), my mentor Laura Bossert's advice, and internet research to choose my recording setup (constrained by the equipment available in the jam room):

> Mid-Side, a standard studio recording technique, with a Shure SM57 Cardioid and an MXL 4000 Figure-8.

### Acknowledgements

Thanks to Caitrin Lynch, the AHS Capstone professor, and Laura Bossert, my Capstone mentor and viola teacher. With Laura's help, I made significant advances in how I think about and play music. I also learned ways to grow as I continue to play music.

Also, thanks to Riley Chapman for letting me borrow his [Cakewalk](http://www.keithstead.com/and_more/reviews/cakewalk_ua-25ex.html) to record my Expo performance.
