# AHS Capstone Complete Draft

Evan Dorsky, 23 November 2015

### Context

I intend to make significant progress during and after break, so this submission will be more of a status update covering what I've done and what I plan to do between now and the end of the semester. This document is also the current incarnation of my website, and it will grow before the end of the semester as well. I'll start with my assessment of the extent to which I've addressed each of my goals so far:

### Goals

- Improve my instrumental music recording skills
    - I cover this in the "Recording the Viola" section below. I'm pleased with my progress here.
- Improve my insturmental music performance skills
    - Working with Laura, I've made great progress here and I'm proud of it. I cover this in the "Playing the Viola".
- Improve my music analysis skills
    - Doing the above two along with this was quite ambitious \- I now realize \- but I think some of my interpretation is informed by my understanding of the structure of the piece (cadences, phrases, beginning/end, etc.). Time permitting, I plan to do some rough harmonic analysis of the piece to better address this goal.

# Playing the Viola

Below I've categorized all of the specific technical lessons/techniques I've learned this semester. Many could feasibly fit in more than one category \- the musical techniques I've learned this semester are deeply integrated, and I think this is a good summary of their common thread:

> No action is abrupt or unexpected. Every action is anticipated and executed confidently, with grace \- and with sensitivity to the context and intent of the music. Actions maximize control of the instrument and sound.

### Confidence (left hand)
- The \"block trill\" and not moving fingers after placement
- No woodpecker (checking the note before playing)
- Puzzle piece (placing the whole hand)
- Subdividing the note before the shift

### Musical interpretation
- Keeping consistent tempo
- Phrasing resolutions
- \"Playing through the bow\"
- Starting and stopping a note

### Right hand

- Anticipating string crossings/double stops
- Double stop technique
- Keeping the bow on the string/see-saw
- Half-pipe for large string crossings

### Position

- Moving the left elbow to aid finger placement
- Fifthy up/fifthy down
- No squid (maintaining good bow hold)

# Recording the Viola

I synthesized my learning from _Big Studio Secrets for Home Recording and Production_, my mentor Laura Bossert's advice, and internet research to make my best educated guess as to the optimal recording setup for my instrument, given the constraints of Olin's equipment and space:

> Either an omnidirectional microphone or two mics in the "Mid-Side" configuration, recording in the room outside the Jam Room (the pool room \- an oddly shaped room with many sound-reflective surfaces).

I've tested this setup with just the omnidirectional mic, and the results have been promising.

# Conclusion and Further Work

I'll note again that I intend to make a lot of progress before the end of the semester. When I met with Jeff, he brought up music visualization as a tool \- I may use this in real\-time during the library opening, and/or on my website to visually illustrate the difference between techniques, if the visualization shows anything interesting. Regardless, I'll be adding some multimedia to this website.

### Before the library opening, I intend to have

- An essentially complete website
- A decent recording of the entire performance
- Prepared techniques to showcase and talk about
- A music visualization of some type (stretch)

### And by Expo, I intend to have

- A complete website
- A good recording of the entire performance
- A prepared live performance
- A prepared talk of some kind to accompany my performance
- A harmonic analysis of some type to discuss (stretch)
