"We put our hardware skills to the test and designed a switched-mode variable 18V 5A power supply.",
"DC power supplies used to transform 60Hz mains to slightly above the desired voltage, then smooth the output with a linear stage (essentially a pass element controlled by an error amplifier). Though simple, these power supplies were inefficient, heavy, and large (thanks to the giant mains transformers). Modern power supplies convert the AC straight to high voltage DC, back to high frequency AC, transform it to around the desired voltage, and use a switching DC-DC converter for the output. While this system is more complicated, it allows the magnetics to shrink by an order of magnitude, and power loss plummets. We designed such a modern power supply, though unfortunately we haven't gotten around to building it."
