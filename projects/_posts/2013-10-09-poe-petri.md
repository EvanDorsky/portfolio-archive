"We designed and built an internet-connected petri dish opacity tester.",
"Our rig held four dishes, and a servo could pivot a photosensor to read the transmission of red light through each one. An Arduino controlled the servo and LEDs in response to serial input, and output the sensor reading over the serial port. The user interface was a webpage hosted by a Node webserver that sent commands to the Arduino with [node-serialport](https://github.com/voodootikigod/node-serialport). The side-effect of using a webserver was that the app could have been hosted online, allowing anyone to control our system from anywhere. We never did this, but it would have been cool."
