header: ["We successfully transmitted (small, grayscale) images between software-defined radios.", "On the transmit end, we encoded the image into binary, split it into two data streams befitting [quadrature amplitude modulation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrature_amplitude_modulation) (4-QAM, in our case, also known as [QPSK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QPSK)), and sent a packet for each row of pixels. On the receive end, we performed open-loop timing correction on the raw binary data and reassembled the image from the packets. The above image (constructed from received packets) shows that not everything made it through the channel... The [paper](/doc/sej-qam/paper.pdf) linked in the banner above goes into more detail."]
