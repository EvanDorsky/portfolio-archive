desc: "Built a 3D scanner by putting an infrared rangefinder on a 2 axis pivot. Captured data with an Arduino and plotted it with Pyplot."

header: [
"We built a 3D scanner that pivoted an infrared range sensor along two axes with two servos.",
"Considering how the final system looked, the scans we got were quite convincing. We positioned the sensor at the center of both rotational axes to make the raw data easy to process. We had the system take it slow to make sure we got good data, which meant each scan took a couple of minutes. We definitely could have pushed that metric, but we weren't evaluated on speed."
