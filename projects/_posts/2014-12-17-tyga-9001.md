desc: "Designed an integrated circuit for a stereo audio amplifier with digitally tunable gain. Laid out the design down to the dimensions of each transistor and had the circuit fabricated."

header: ["We put our faces on an integrated circuit die. We had room left over for a stereo audio amplifier with volume control.", "We designed a mixed analog/digital circuit -- the analog is an [op-amp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_amplifier) configured as a non-inverting amplifier, and the digital is a [SPI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface_Bus) bus (almost fully compliant) controlling a digital potentiometer to tune the gain. It was fabricated with the MOSIS 300 nm process on a 1 mm square die and packaged in a 40 pin ceramic DIP. None of those specs were by choice. See the [report](/doc/tyga-9001/paper.pdf) (linked above in the banner) for details."]
